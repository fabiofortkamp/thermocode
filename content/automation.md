In [one of the last episodes of Cortex](http://www.relay.fm/cortex/13 ), CGP Grey said something that stuck with me and made me reflect on some tech problems I've been encoutering. He said, comparing working on a Mac versus working on an iPad, that he prefers to use the latter because it does not allow the use of automation scripts and other hacks, so it's easier to just sit down and work.

There are three things that have been happening in my life that have been making me think about how I use technology to get work done.

For the past few weeks, I've been taking part on the structuration of a research group in Magnetic Refrigeration here at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. There is a Professor, a post-doc student and some Master's and undergraduate students. I'm the only Ph.D. student (as of now), so I and the post-doc student are leading the process of implementing some practices.

This is the first time in my professional life that I have to collaborate with such a number of people. There are several interconnected projects, developed by different groups. I will take part in some of them, and the post-doc student will supervise the whole process. This means that I do not work alone anymore; the tasks I do must be monitored by other people, so that they can track my progress (they may be waiting for a report I'm creating, for example).

This also means I can't use [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/ ) 
, the program I use as a task manager, as it has zero collaboration features and is exclusive to the Apple ecossytem. This is the first problem.

The second problem is that, at the  beginning of my *real* work as Ph.D. student, I will have to run simulation programs that exist only (or are licensed in our lab group only) for Windows.

Which means, once again, that *I can't use Omnifocus anymore*.

Well, I could. For the sort of "Big Picture" management of our projects, we've been experimenting with [Trello](http://trello.com ) 
, which seems very nice. This is where we mantain checklists for each person. I periodically go there and check off the tasks I complete (I've been doing this at the end of the day, as a way to do a general review ). But I still want to have a finer control of my tasks; in my checklists on Trello, I have something like "Complete review of paper X", but on my day-to-day task lists I have a recurring task to just read the paper, and may have others to "set up LaTeX project", "search for reference Y to link to paper X" etc. My colleagues who are waiting for my review (and my advisor, mainly) don't need to know this sort of thing. To balance between these two systems (one for *projects* and one for *next actions*, in GTD parlance), I periodically review them. Like I said, once a day I log into Trello and review my assigned tasks, and once a week I do a general review, creating links between big picture projects and tasks.

I've always used Omnifocus for my tasks. Sure, I could still use my MacBook (and OF), remotely accessing the Windows machine, or even creating a virtual machine (although this is not a really viable solution, as the simulation softwares will soon find the bottleneck of being virtualized). Or I could use the Windows PC and bring my (old) iPad 2, just to use Omnifocus and have something like a digital assistant. Or I could use all sorts of hacks, like printing task lists, or using the mail plugins for OF...

Now, from what point on will my *need* for using Omnifocus start to get into my way of working?

There is a third problem. I still have an iPhone 4s, which is small, buggy and outdated. Now, if you haven't checked the dollar exchange rates for BRL and the Apple gear prices, you should, to have some fun. It's absolutely ridiculous, and I can't maintain this standard. I've already decided to get an Android phone, and so I need to use cross-platform applications.

I've always taken pride on being a OS X user, and how it has better programming environments, and better software, and it is **much easier to automate**. Take my [`skim2md` script](http://thermocode.net/blog/skim2md/ ) 
, for example; it has been used a lot lately, but do I really *need* it to work? On Windows, where this sort of automation is not possible, I could still use any PDF reader, annotate the papers, and then manually write a summary of it. 

There are so many intersting technologies, most of them cross-platform (and mostly web-based). There are [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/ ) 
, and [LaTeX](https://www.tug.org/texlive) 
, and [GitHub](http://github.com ) 
, and [Slack](http://slack.com ) 
, and [Trello](http://trello.com ) 
 -- all of them are being used on our research group. I don't want and cannot be the type of guy that needs to work on a Mac, or can only use certain applications. As CGP Grey said, sometimes we do not need the most advanced operating system to work. I just need to simplify my tech needs.

There is a [simple living manifesto](http://zenhabits.net/simple-living-manifesto-72-ideas-to-simplify-your-life/ ) 
 by Leo Babauta that I absolutely adore. I found that periodically I have to revisit this post and do some reflection. If using Omnifocus is creating more problems than solutions, I will ditch it. If being able to work on the Windows PC that the lab provides me can make things much simpler (and my backpack lighter), so be it. If my zsh terminal system do not work on Windows, I will get back to bash, which can be easily used on Windows with the surpriginly good [Git Bash](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads ) 
. If my Emacs configuration is consuming much of my time and mental energy, I will radically simplify it.

Right now, I'm doing the transition of my system to a cross-platform world. My goal is that I want to be able to work on my MacBook (if what I'm doing  does not require Windows, like reading, writing and coding), which you stay mostly at home, and go to the university and use the Windows PC and pick up the work *almost exactly* as if I were using my Mac. I've being doing this carefully and dedicating time to it; sometimes you just have to  stop work and  *clear the paths of work*, as [Kourosh Dini](http://thermocode.net/blog/better-work/ ) 
 prays. I'm not letting this steal my whole time, though; I always start my day working on my main research project (at least three hours in the morning), and only later in the day will I work on this organization. As for tasks problem, I've been trying [Todoist](http://todoist.com) and it has been playing very nice.

And just to be clear, this is not a goodbye letter of this site. **thermocode.net** is a place to show my work, and as [Dr. Drang said](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/01/my-report-writing-workflow/ ), my job is to create reports (and papers, and simulation programs), not workflows. I will write posts documenting how I accomplish work, no matter which device I'm using.
