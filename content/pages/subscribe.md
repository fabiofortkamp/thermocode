There is the standard [RSS feed](http://thermocode.net/feeds/all.atom.xml), for the real geeks. This feed subscribes to all posts.

There isn't a mailing list or newsletter yet, but you could use [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com ) as an alternative, for now. I've even setup up two recipes: [one](https://ifttt.com/recipes/317864-thermocode-net-to-email) for receiving new posts by email (the message formatting, however, is not excellent), and [another](https://ifttt.com/recipes/317865-thermocode-net-to-instapaper) to automatically save new articles to Instapaper, if you have an account (and you can even [create one for free](http://instapaper.com)).

You can also [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/fabiofortkamp ), where I will tweet links to new posts.
