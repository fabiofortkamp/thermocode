*This text is adapted from [the first post of this blog](http://thermocode.net/blog/welcome)*

Welcome to **thermocode.net**. Allow me to introduce myself and explain what this site is about.

My name is Fábio Fortkamp, and I am a Ph.D. student in the Mechanical Engineering graduate program at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, located in southern Brazil. As I write this, I'm just beginning my journey, but I'll study the optimization of magnetic refrigerators (and I will write *a lot* about this subject, so don't worry if you don't even understand this term).

I also have a bunch of other interests; I try to read books as much as I can, alternating between non-fiction and imaginative literature. I like to cook and to drink beer. I enjoy watching movies with my girlfriend. I listen to several podcasts. And I'm also a self-confessed nerd.

This site is a place where I can document my work -- and by work, I mean exactly what [Kourosh Dini](http://www.kouroshdini.com/) means in his wonderful [Creating Flow with Omnifocus (Second Edition)](https://gumroad.com/l/creating_flow_with_omnifocus)

> [W]ork is the action that brings benefit to the self and/or environment.

I've thinking about this for a long time, but the final dose of inspiration came from [Austin Kleon's](http://austinkleon.com/) [*Show your work!*](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered/dp/076117897X/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439395729&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=show+your+workl), in which he writes:

> Amateurs are not afraid to make mistakes or look ridiculous in public. They’re in love, so they don’t hesitate to do work that others think of as silly or just plain stupid. [They] might lack formal training, but they’re all lifelong learners, and they make a point of learning in the open, so that others can learn from their failures and successes. [...] They’re just regular people who get obsessed by something and spend a ton of time thinking out loud about

Based on my own experience, when you have to explain something, your own understanding of it increases. So, by adopting an “amateur mentality”, if you regularly show your work to someone, even if it is not ready, this process iteratively increases the quality of your work.

Prof. Cal Newport [discusses this same question](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/08/10/you-know-what-you-write-the-textbook-method-for-ultra-learning/), writing about a situation when he created a wiki page to summarize results he found for one problem, and it advanced quickly, while in another problem he did nothing but read about it:

> Here we have a nice comparison. In two cases I spent roughly the same amount of time trying to learn new knowledge. In one case, I efficiently mastered a new area, while in another, I ended up frustrated.
>
> The comparison highlights the power of a simple act: describing and organizing information in your own words.

I perform several tasks as part of my scientific  work: I write papers, notes and reports (using LaTeX and Markdown); I take notes while reading various documents; I develop scripts to perform calculations; I create plots and manipulate images. Most of these tasks happen on my computer, and my system of choice is a MacBook Pro running OS X with several applications. In this blog, I will show how I work with this system: why I use a Mac (and the Apple ecosystem in general), which apps  I use and why, how I optimize my setup. I will share my journey of learning and using the Python programming language to do all sorts of stuff. I will share many things I've learned while using LaTeX (and new things that I will learn). I will write a note to myself as I learn a new concept (related to my thesis) and will post it here.

But this is not a pure engineering blog (although some posts will be heavy in math; consider yourself warned). As I read non-fiction books, I will post things that I've learned. I have great interest in productivity and how to work and live better, so expect some texts around these more general topics.

And last but not least, English is not my native language but I really want to get better at it.

I am deeply fascinated by all of these things. I hope that you will find these things interesting as well.

## My influences

I have several. [Dr. Drang](http://leancrew.com/all-this) is the most obvious one, alongside with [Dr. Bunsen](http://www.drbunsen.org/), in their use of science and math to explain the world.

In the realm of productivity and work in general, I am profoundly influenced by everything I read from the already cited [Prof. Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog) and [Kourosh Dini](http://usingomnifocus.com), whose masterpiece [*Workflow Mastery*](https://gumroad.com/l/tkbY) will be the source of my first posts here (and indeed, in the spirit of *Show your work!*, this site is being created now so that I have a place to write about this wonderful book).

## What this name means

To tell you the true story, I've been struggling with this name for more than a year. I was reading [*Test-Driven Development of Python*, by Harry J.W. Percival](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029533.do) , and there is a chapter where the author emphasized the importance of actually creating an account in a server and pratice uploading a site. So I did, but to test the recipes from the book I had to finally decide on a domain name. I decided on **thermocode.net**, which unites two of my main interests and passions: thermodynamics and coding. In the end, I think it's actually a cool name.

If you can read in Portuguese, you might want to check out [my other blog](http://fabiofortkamp.com), which is rarely updated. I tend to write there about life in general; I created **thermocode.net** because I wanted a place where I can write in more technical terms about my work.

## Following this blog

This site is still in its infancy, so there aren't a lot of ways of following the blog. There is a [subscription page](http://thermocode.net/subscribe ), and you can follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/fabiofortkamp).

And, before we say goodbye, thanks for reading!
