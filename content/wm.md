How to do better work?

This is the central problem that [Kourosh Dini](http://twitter.com/kouroshdini ) tries to address in his [*Workflow Mastery*](http://www.usingomnifocus.com) (The Dini Group, 2014). And his central answer is that we can achieve better experiences when we are in a state of *play*. 

A good friend of mine, who is a Professor at a federal university and is one example (to me) of a successful person, sure knew how to play. When  he was studying to enter universities as a professor and shared a lab room with me, it always amazed me how he got to focus on what he was doing. Contrary to many people I know, he could not be seen checking YouTube every 5 minutes --  he does not even have a Facebook account. He learned how to put his head over the books, and take notes, and he did this all day. And he got what we wanted.

The idea of focus as a key ingredient of better work is neither new nor exclusive to this book. Here is Brian Tracy
 in [*Eat that frog!*](http://www.amazon.com/Eat-That-Frog-Great-Procrastinating-ebook/dp/B00BYGU9A0/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1440426593&sr=1-1&keywords=eat+that+frog) (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2007):

> Throughout my career, I have discovered and rediscovered a simple truth. The ability to concentrate singlemindedly on your most important task, to do it well and to finish it completely, is the key to great sucess, achievement, respect, status, and happiness in life.

[Prof. Cal Newport, one my main influences](http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/11/11/if-youre-busy-youre-doing-something-wrong-the-surprisingly-relaxed-lives-of-elite-achievers/), cites a research on the marks of an elite violin player:

> The difference was in how they spent this time. The elite players were spending almost three times more hours than the average players on deliberate practice — the uncomfortable, methodical work of stretching your ability.

Hence, to do better at something requires us to learn how to play with the experience, to fully immerse in it, to put one self in a state of deliberate focus, so that nothing else pops in our head.

However, according to Dini, there is one other factor, often neglected in texts about productivity, and that is of *mastery*. To do good work, you must be good at work. In particular, doing work should be natural. If I was assigned a task of creating a video, and I immersed myself in the experience, with no distractions, I still would not be able to produce a good video, as I'm not familiar with the process and have not developed any intimacy.

Hence, optimal work and experiences arise when we *play* with them, having mastered them and in a state of full focus. All the rest of the study of productivity, organization and workflow come from this premise.

I had to read *Workflow Mastery* three times before I got to really understand it, and this book has been influencing me a lot in the past couple of months. As a Ph.D. student, taking demanding courses and starting to plan my thesis project, I find myself tackling difficult intellectual tasks, and the work ammount tends to steadly increase. At the same time, I see many colleagues and professors losing complete control of their time, working long hours and not always producing great results.

I firmly believe that, being still young, I have time to create better work habits. I must learn how to do better, more efficient, and more result-centric work.

In this series, I will explore the many concepts I've learned from *Workflow Mastery* in my continuous attempt to improve my work and personal life -- and, along the way, I will share my own observations on the topic of productivity. This does not indent to be a replacement to the book, which your should buy if you are interested in this topic (it's on sale right now).  Dini is a psychiatrist who can understand the mind much better than I can, and is a writer, musician and overall more experienced person than me. This is just an attempt to show some of the things I've learned from this incredible book, and in this process, I expect to increase my own understanding (like I said in the [first post](http://thermocode.net/blog/welcome/ ), a great part of the motivation for building this site is to have a place to flush the ideas from the book out of my head).
