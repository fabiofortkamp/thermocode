As I've mentioned in the [first post of this series][series-intro], I'm writing these texts because I want to learn to do better work. I'm developing my professional life, having started my biggest challenge so far (my Ph.D. thesis) just a year ago, and I observe many people working with different styles: friends, lab colleagues, relatives -- and I pay special attention to the ones I consider successful. And there's one thing I've learned: you can accomplish many things but destroy your marriage and family life, working long hours or having no sense of weekends or breaks, or you could be successful and maintain a balance with your other areas of your life. These people work less hours, but work *better*. I want to be in this second group.

How to do that? There is no magic; we all have deadlines and a certain ammount of work to do between them, so we must manage our finite time. A personal example: right now I'm working on a program that finds and plots the analytical solution to Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism on a certain geometry. The major deadline for this is in 6 months, when I will have to defend my qualifying exam, but just having written this program will not be enough for passing. I have to find the mathematical solution, graphically demonstrate it, and then modify the other programs created by members of our research group on magnetic refrigeration to account for this new geometry I'm investigating. If I have to do all of this (and various other things) before April, I have a minimum ammount of work per day. If some day I sit down to work but cannot do anything (because of things that [prevent play](http://thermocode.net/blog/no-play ) 
), and if this situation repeats, then I will reach March and will not have done enough. Since I have to pass the qualification exam, I will then have to work long hours on that month. *This* is what I want to avoid. There must be some way of maximizing the quality of my work, to prevent these bad days to proliferate.

Kourosh Dini's [*Workflow Mastery* (The Dini Group, 2014)][wm] is an excellent treatise on this topic, and, after having read it many times, I'm constantly revisiting the topics so that I can test them in my real life and increase my understanding. And one thing that has done a great impact on my life is the power of just *pausing*.

It might seem a bit counterintuitive to use pause as a productivity tool, but it really is. Here's one example of how a work session can be ruined (leading to the situation described above): I'm working on a presentation to give, and for some reason what I'm doing is terribly boring. I then remember that on the previous day I saw a book that seem interesting, so I go to Amazon and begin reading about it, and Amazon shows me all other book from the same author. I download a Kindle sample, and begin reading it, and then suddenly forty minutes have passed -- forty minutes where I have not worked towards my goal. I've done this sort of thing many times.

Here is a better way of solving this. You are working and get bored or worried about something;  this is normal and is how our mind works. Instead of jumping to Amazon or YouTube, and rushing to call or email someone, just pause. Pause and breathe, and ask yourself what is on your mind. What's bothering you? Write your thoughts down, so you can review them later. Oh,  are you just really tired? Take a breath and check that your work is saved somehow, and assure that you can remember what you were doing. If you are tired, then *acknowledge* you are tired, set a timer for 5-10 minutes and go drink some water, or grab a snack. Yes, you also have stopped working, but not in a wandering manner, and not just quitting your work.

These concepts of *pause* and *acknowledgement* are actually very profound, and since having contact with them there is not a single day where I haven't used the power of pause. Dini writes on his other book, *Creating Flow with OmniFocus, second edition*:

> In fact, I find that pausing is probably the most important and likely most underutilized tool of productivity.

Here are some examples of how this have improved my life:

* I remember one day when I was writing a report at home, and I noticed a serious flaw on one program I wrote to generate some plots. I wanted to immediately stop what I was doing and going to the university to fix this issues (since I needed a program I don't have on my own computer, and the due date was arriving soon), but then I paused. I didn't plan to go to the university on that day, but I was planning to go on the next day. Could this wait until the other day? Well, the issue affected many sections, but not all of them. Since I was at home, I could concentrate on finishing what I *could* do on that day, and the next day all I would  have to do is fix the program, re-generate the figures and insert them on my report. If I just quit the session and rushed to the university, I would have lost a bunch of time just on commute, let alone the anger. Hence, pausing, analyzing the problem without desperation and realizing that I could fix this problem the other day, when I was indeed planning to go to the university, actually saved me time
* I was doing an exam once and left a couple of minutes after the time to catch my bus. My first instinct was to just grab everything and rush to the bus stop. But then I paused, and realized that by that time the traffic would be bad anyway, and that I was too tired to go chase a bus. Just one breath was enough to convince me that I could just drink some water and go home later, to avoid traffic. I used that time when I was waiting to read and write, much more productively.
* Just today, I was solving a backup issue on my computer, but I started to get hungry and ran to the restaurant. Of course, because I have not paused and acknowledged what the situation was, I have thought about my problem the whole time during lunch, effecticely ruining my experience of eating. Have I taken the time to just write down what I could try after the lunch and organize my thoughts, the experience would be different

I could go on, but you get the idea. You should really try this. Before beginning the work or rushing to finish it, pause and ackowledge what's going on (I do this every day). When a distraction pops up, pause for 5 seconds and *do nothing*, and then deal with it consciously. You will find that much of your stress and anxiety will go away.

Brian Tracy, in [*Eat that frog!*][etf] (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2007): has an interesting quote that reminds me of this concept:

> Sometimes people come up to me and ask, "How do I achieve balance between my work and and my home life?"
>
> I ask them in return, "How often does a tightrope walker balance when on the high wire?" After a few seconds of thinking, they almost always say, "All the tome". I say, "That is the same situation with balance between work and home life. You have to do it all the time. You never reach a point where you have attained it perfectly. You have to work at it".

We all have to work at it. We are not automatons, and cannot continue working all day long without stopping. Only by pausing we are able to evaluate ourselves, the quality of our work, and recongnize that we are done for the day. As Dini says:

> So what does this mean to “do something until we’re done?” We are done when no further or new thoughts come to mind even while focused upon something. But even more definitively, we are done when we consciously decide we are done.﻿

Now, before thinking deeply about this post, just pause.
