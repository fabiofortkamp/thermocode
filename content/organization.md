Series: Kourosh Dini's Workflow Mastery  

Let us take a pause of our ongoing discussion of Python and Unix to resume our series on Kourosh Dini's [*Workflow Mastery*](http://www.usingomnifocus.com) (The Dini Group, 2014). I've been so immersed in developing Python code and writing papers and reports that a pause to reflect on how can I improve these flows is a good idea.

As we've been discussing in this series, what prevents us doing good work is not being able to play, instead losing time (and, sometimes more important, mental energy) with non-important things. For example, I've writing a important document that summarizes my research so far. As it is common in academia, I use LaTeX and have created many custom commands to standardize the mathematical notation for my problem. Later, when I write other documents, I would like to reuse these commands, but the process of moving this information from file to file is awkward and error-prone, as I have to maintain several files and updating a single command becomes more difficult than necessary. Hence, in the path of me writing scientific documents (a major part of my work routines), there is a difficulty, and Dini points out:

To keep our conditions to achieve the state of play, the process of *clearing paths* (or *organizing*) is important. Organization, then, is not the act of making something prettier or "cleaner", but actually more functional; beauty and elegance can sometimes arise as consequences. I absolutely love this quote: 

> Elegance marks organizational maturity.

In my aforementioned problems, I took a day off and created a LaTeX package with all commands (you can even [check it out](https://github.com/PoloMag/magref-latex)). Now, I just import this package from all documents, and I can easily add new commands to a single file. How did I know that it was better to stop doing the "real work" and start organizing? Through the power of pause and acknowledgement. As I was preparing a new document, I noticed how clumsy it was to copy all the commands and I realized that I will likely have *many* documents to write that use the same macros. In the process of creating this package, I also learned myself a lot (see first quote above) about creating LaTeX packages, which is a useful skill to have you write LaTeX every day as I do.

{Expandid questão de aprender a observar o próprio trabalho e reconhecer frustações. Às vezes, então, organziar se torna o trabalho em si. Como diferenciar? Como reconhecer e identificar as intenções de organização?}.

The opposite process, to stop organizing and resume working on the original project, is most times harder, because, let's assume it, organizing is funnier. There are no strictly rules, and acknowledging is again out best ally. Spending a month writing a massive LaTeX package that would be used by a whole team, say, for the next two years does not seem absurd to me.

I think a key idea is to create time boundaries. In my example, I decided to spend an afternoon and see what I could create (it turns out, it was enough!). As another example, I have the habit of after every workday perform a *workday closing routine* (I even have a checklist for it in Evernote). For the last thirty minutes of my workday, I process my email, update my team's Trello boards, do some minor filing tasks etc. This helps me keep my paths clear in the course of a day, and I avoid spend too much time orgnizing and little time writing and coding (my primary activities).
