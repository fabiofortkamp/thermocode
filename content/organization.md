What prevents us doing good work is not being able to play and lose time with non-important things.

To maintain a system, *clearing paths* (or *organizing*) is important.

A practical example: when writing my LaTeX files, having to copy my cutom LaTeX packages over and over disturb me from the process of actually writing.

solution: write my own package file. In 2 hours I had this done and things should be much easier now. Organizing is sometimes part of the work. How to know when to stop organizing? Pausing and acknowledging.

Another example: everyday I dedicate 30 minutes to close my day. It may seem like a lot, but this means that during the day I seldom check email or messing with my Trello boards. I sync my iPhone podcast playlist, so that I can fully enjoy my gym experience.

Talk about templates? How they can improve our daily flows, by "gently" presenting themselves.

Focus on examples of organization!

> By recognizing an unclear path, we often realize the possibility for better settings, better practice, and better learning.


﻿


> There are essentially three conditions that can suggest a better state of organization: 1. When we would like something useful for whatever it is that we are doing 2. When we try to get to or use something in a better way than we are now 3. When something is in our way.


﻿


> An object’s Organizational State is the degree to which: 1. We are Aware2 of it and its relevance to our workflows 2. It is Accessible when supportive to our workflows 3. It is Avoidable when it would otherwise impede our workflows

Awareness is being conscious that some object may help in some flow.


For example, when studying some math class, it helps my flow to know the functions available in my calculator.


﻿


> Awareness is knowledge1 appearing at a threshold of consideration.


﻿


> The more fully we allow the process, the greater our awareness of what may be relevant. It is in a pause, as brief as it may be, where I may come up with the idea that a useful application may exist for which I can now search.


﻿


> Relevance is an object’s connection or relationship to an intention in meaning, space, and time.


﻿


> Recognizing relevance refers to the recognition of how an object is connected to an experience. Is it useful? Is it not? How is it useful or in the way?


﻿


> Accessibility is the existence and clarity of a path between an object and a relevant intention.


﻿


> Accessibility is measured in degrees. Something can be more or less reachable or useful than at other times. In other words, we can improve accessibility by degrees. Sometimes we do so over time, such as when we develop a skill with regular practice.


﻿


> Avoidability is the absence of an object or a path to an object irrelevant to an intention.


﻿


> It should be noted that an object’s avoidability when irrelevant enhances the accessibility of other objects more relevant to our present work.

The task of organization then consists of finding the relevant objects and improve their pillars.


But remember: we always start with a flow we intend to enhance.


﻿


> Ideally, we seek for objects supporting a flow to immediately come to mind when useful, be effortless to reach and use when useful, and otherwise be invisible.

And that is why we organize.


﻿


> Some intentions are much more likely to actualize by virtue of their support in organization.


﻿


> In fact, there are times when work cannot be developed at all until certain organizational conditions are met. For example, I cannot use a particular program on the computer until I have actually installed it.


﻿


> Much of mastery is a mastery of the basics.


﻿


> Invisibility is not necessarily an object’s absence from sight, so much as it is absence from mind.


﻿


> when we can fully and honestly trust that something will be where we want it, when we want it, it can better remain off of the mind.


﻿


> Useful questions to consider when organizing are: How will this be off of my mind when irrelevant? or  How may I place this object so I may trust it will return to my attention when relevant?


﻿


> Invisibility, as a practice of honesty with oneself, becomes one of the most mature aspects of organization.


﻿


> By maintaining a clutter-free environment, we keep extraneous and unplanned triggers of thought away from attention.


﻿


> Cleanliness is the degree to which we arrange the environment to allow and promote agency.

It just occurred to me that the fact that misplaced objects and thougts disturb our process of flow is an axiom, or it seems to be something we do not yet understand.


But it is from this fact that we must carefully organize ou work environment.


﻿


> Each may be considered to have some effect upon our attention and bring to mind thoughts, both subtly and not so subtly.


﻿


> Cleanliness, more accurately, refers to the degree to which we can readily reach any aspect of our work, with minimal adversity posed by the environment, when we believe it would be meaningful and useful to do so, and to remain out of our way otherwise.


﻿


> It is the continual work of freeing and supporting agency, and therefore also about supporting our ability to design our environments to promote the development of play, mastery, and meaningful work.


﻿


> To know when something will be in demand is a prediction, a best guess.


﻿


> Carrying tasks forward while considering their present and future optimization is an unending act of living.


﻿


> There is no complete state of being “organized”. For an individual project, the pursuit of organizing does not end,


﻿


> Organization is an ideal.  We may see that flows do not always readily accommodate each other and decisions of compromise are often necessary. New ideas might come to mind as we organize or do our work.


﻿


> Such aesthetics may not always be pretty in some conventional sense, but often reflect a beauty related to a meaning unique to the individual and the system.


﻿

We cannot ignore some detais like this about our mind, because our life and work is a result of our mind.


﻿


> Fine aesthetics inspire us to find new play in work.


﻿


> A pleasing and attractive environment, more than simply nice to see, can welcome the relaxing conditions often useful for creative endeavors.


﻿


> Two questions that can be helpful in working to improve the beauty of an environment or piece of work may be: If it is ugly, what makes it ugly? If it is beautiful, what makes it beautiful?


﻿


> Elegance is beauty and strength, Often simple in nature, Highlighted in a relief of invisibility. Elegance marks organizational maturity.


﻿

An argument: the state of flow can be enhanced when the elegance of our systems support our path.


I can recall to this: I find great joy in working with Emacs in a smarter way, with the right commands.


﻿


> A workflow consists of the paths and components involved in moving an object or objects from one state to another in space, time, or experience.


﻿


> An organizational structure (also called organizational framework) is an object or system of objects designed to support or clear a path for a flow or development.


﻿


> To organize and improve our workflows, we can then imagine for each recognized point of flow, how we may: Be aware of relevant objects and other flows Improve their accessibility when relevant Improve their avoidability when irrelevant


﻿


> In terms of time, space, and experience, we picture: The beginning state The transitional points between beginning and end The ending

Nofice that a central propositition is that moving objects to more meaningful places (not just in space) is primary to organizing flows


﻿


> For any particular point of workflow, we may consider:  1. What is useful at this point? 2. What is in the way? 3. What else might be useful?


﻿


> Before we begin an organizational process, we do well to have an organizational intention and to consider the conditions in which the intention will be developed. 


﻿


> The following suggested stages should be understood as overlapping and in continual flux: 1. Acknowledge the frustration or desire inspiring organization 2. Acknowledge the organizational intention Upon deciding to organize: 3. Invest time, space, and attention into organizing 4. Acknowledge the paths and components of the workflow 5. Optimize and acknowledge awareness, availability, and accessibility for each path and component


﻿


> While we may decide to drift along with the world’s currents, we cannot develop play, create work, or address desire and anxiety without the ability to consider: Where we are Where we might like to go A next step between here and there
