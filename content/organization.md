Series: Kourosh Dini's Workflow Mastery  

Let us take a pause of our [ongoing discussion of Python and Unix](http://thermocode.net/blog/path/) to resume our series on Kourosh Dini's [*Workflow Mastery*](http://www.usingomnifocus.com) (The Dini Group, 2014). I've been so immersed in developing Python code and writing papers and reports that a pause to reflect on how can I improve these flows is a good idea.

As we've been discussing in this series, what prevents us from doing good work is not being able to play, instead losing time (and, sometimes more important, mental energy) with little things that add nothing to our lives. For example, I've been writing a important document that summarizes my research so far. As it is common in academia, I use LaTeX and then I had to create many custom commands to standardize the mathematical notation for my problem. Later, when I write other documents (mainly research papers), I would like to reuse these commands, but the process of moving this information from file to file is awkward and error-prone, as I have to maintain several files and updating a single command becomes more difficult than necessary. Hence, in the path of me writing scientific documents (a major part of my work routine), there is a difficulty, and Dini points out:

> By recognizing an unclear path, we often realize the possibility for better settings, better practice, and better learning.

To keep our conditions to achieve the state of play, the process of *clearing paths* (or *organizing*) is important. Organization, then, is not the act of making something prettier or "cleaner", but actually more functional; beauty and elegance can sometimes arise as consequences. I absolutely love this quote: 

> Elegance marks organizational maturity.

In my aforementioned problem, I took a day off and created a LaTeX package with all commands (you can even [check it out](https://github.com/PoloMag/magref-latex)). Now, I just import this package from all documents, and I can easily add new commands to a single file. How did I know that it was better to stop doing the "real work" and start organizing? Through the [power of pause](http://thermocode.net/blog/pause) and acknowledgement. As I was preparing a new document, I noticed how clumsy it was to copy all the commands and I realized that I will likely have *many* documents to write that use the same LaTeX macros. In the process of creating this package, I also learned myself a lot (see first quote above) about creating LaTeX packages, which is a useful skill to have you write LaTeX every day as I do.

As I interrupted the composition of my document, the process of organizing this process became the work itself. It may seem counter-productive to stop writing and begin fiddling with LaTeX, since my work will be evaluated by the quality of the report and not by the beauty and effectiveness of my LaTeX programming; however, this exact quality of my report depend not only on time spent on it but on how I can concentrate while working on it. [John D. Cook](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/22/automate-to-save-mental-energy-not-time/) has a graat post arguing that automation sometimes makes more sense as a resource to save mental energy and not time. Now, when I sit to write, I am sure that I have a single place where my LaTeX macros are stored, and that this is the canonical source of notation for my PhD work (if you work with scientific document in engineering or exact sciences, you certainly know how complex is the task to manage greek and roman letters, sub- and superscripts etc).

The opposite process, to stop organizing and resume working on the original project, is most times harder, because, let's assume it, organizing is fun. There are no strictly rules, and acknowledging is again out best ally. I think a key idea is to create time boundaries. In my example, I decided to spend an afternoon and see what I could create (it turns out, it was enough). Spending a month writing a massive LaTeX package that would be used by a whole team, say, for the next two years does not seem absurd to me. What *is* absurb in my opinion is trying to work in a extremely disorganized environment. For example, if you are trying to read an important book and the lamp on your desk keeps blinking, realize that stoping to read and go exchange the lamp is not a waste of time, as the five minutes required to do so will be convert on more focus. 

Hence, I agree with Kourosh Dini that the act of organizing our work should become a matter of routine, and that we do better by observing our very work. Try to avoid worries to pop in your head in the middle of your day. For example, I have the habit of after every workday perform a *workday closing routine* (I even have a checklist for it in Evernote); for the last thirty minutes of my workday, I process my email, update my team's Trello boards, do some minor filing tasks etc. This helps me keep my paths clear (have you noticed that I love this expression?) in the course of a day, and I avoid spend too much time organizing and little time writing and coding (my primary activities). My mind becomes calmer while I read, study, write, program, have meeting etc because I trust that after all of that I will do a recap, making sure that in the next day my task list is updated, emails are taken care of and so on.

This only works if you learn to observe yourself working. The more automatic you work, perhaps faster you deliver things, but at the cost of quality. I believe we all have to learn to be more mindful of our work.
