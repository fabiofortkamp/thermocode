When I started this series on Jupyter notebooks, I wrote it is "my most used tool" and that I think its installation and usage for Windows users may not be very straigthforward.

As I've written before, I learned to use Linux when I was taking CS classes in Portugal, and I learned some key concepts that changed the way I use a computer. I learned that every task you perform at your computer is translated into calls (instructions) to the operating system; when you select a file (say, `file.txt`) in your Desktop and hit the `Delete` key, the OS finds the portion in the memory where the file lives and frees that slot. With a terminal and shell programming languages, you can interact with the OS bypassing the graphical interface, by typing `rm ~/Desktop/file.txt` into a terminal. I learned to use Bash and I fell empowered with it.

I also learned the concept of processes.
