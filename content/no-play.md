Series: Kourosh Dini's Workflow Mastery  

I live alone, so I have to clean my apartment by myself. For a few months, this was a cause of constant worry; I can recall many situations where I was at the university, studying for some exam, and then suddenly my mind wandered, making me think about *all those things* I would have to do when I got home, and how it was a terrible mistake to move out of my parents's house, and how I have so little time left for me now, and so on. The experience of studying would be completely destroyed.

Studying for an exam is one example of what Kourosh Dini calls a *flow* ([*Workflow Mastery*](http://www.usingomnifocus.com), The Dini Group, 2014), which I understand as a sequence of events with a goal that improves our life somehow. During a normal day, we experience many flows, work-related (such as writing or creating a presentation) or not (imagine little things like setting the table for breakfast). Like I said in the [previous post](http://thermocode.net/blog/better-work/ ), optimal work is the result of play, when we can focus on a task and do it in a natural way. Our daily flows are enhanced when we play with them.

What prevents this state of play? Why wasn't I able to fully concentrate on the studying? The important detail is, we cannot ignore the power of worries and anxiety on our mind. As Dini writes:

> Ideas and emotions can come to mind because something we find meaningful now demands maintenance or development. We worry about that phone call we need to make. We worry that we have deadlines. [...] We cannot focus on creating a nice vacation or preparing the meal without tasks of work intruding or a general sense of anxiety pervading our thoughts. In a sense, we lose trust in our own experience.

So it seems that *trust* is a big component of our daily flows. This is how Dini defines it:

> Trust is a primary stage of infant development. So, too, is it important to our workflows. It is only when we trust our environments to support us, to not be intrusive, to engage us when it would be best, perhaps to even empathize with us, and to help us develop what we find to be meaningful, that we can be our best selves. [...] When we believe that our meaningful ideas, projects, tasks, etc., are being maintained or developed to some degree, addressed in whatever way we can fully acknowledge, they no longer intrude.

Going back to my previous example, had I had a system which I trusted and where I could store my intentions to clean my apartment, probably I would not worry about this and could return to the studying. Maybe I would still stop and think about, but I could then remind myself: "I know I have to clean my apartment, but I'm not there. When I get there, my phone will alert me and prompt to do some house chores."

Indeed, this was exactly what I did. After studying the [FlyLady](http://flylady.net) method with more detail, I created a series of repeating tasks in Omnifocus (with some auxiliary Taskpaper templates, as suggested by Dini in his other book, *Creating Flow with Omnifocus, Second Edition* (The Dini Group, 2014)). Every week day at 17:00, when I usually finish my Ph.D. tasks, I see a task like "Check cleaning list for today" in my main Omnifocus view (one of these days I will talk about my Omnifocus setup, but *Creating Flow...* is a primary source of ideas). I then open my cleaning list, where I see that the next task is "Clean kitchen's windows". I do that, and check off that task in the Taskpaper file. In the following day, the same flagged task will apear in Omnifocus, and there will be another suggestion to clean the house. Once a week, I also get gently prompted to do a more general cleaning of the house (sweeping, cleaning the bathroom etc).

Now, when I'm studying and a worry like this example comes to mind, I pause and reflect that I trust my system. As I get more and more organized, I have this permanent feeling that the important things in my life are being treated. I know that, once I get home, I'll recognize that actually it is great to be a little independent from my parents, and that all I have to do in order to keep things in order is dedicate a couple of minutes to some house chores. And, while cleaning the house, I get another excuse to listen to some nice podcasts, which is also great.

To summarize: what prevents play, what stops us from doing great work, is out lack of trust and our inability of dealing with worries. As previously discussed, when working, you should be focus on the work itself. When going to bed to sleep, you should be fully relaxed. When watching TV, you should immerse in that experience and not think about the next day.

In the next posts in this series, we will investigate Dini's suggestions for creating better conditions for play and my own experiences with them.
