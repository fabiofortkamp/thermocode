Continuing with my ongoing theme about simplifying tech, being more portable, enjoying open systems more, I feel obligated to tell my impressions on my first Android Device: a Moto X Play from 2015.

First the obligatory backstory. My parents went to the US on 2012 and brought me a super shiny iPhone 4S (the latest model at the time). I had two proto-smatphones from Nokia before that (in the sense that are some primitive apps like calendar and email, and that it could serve as an MP3 player), but this was different. It was intuitive, good-loking, well-manufactured. And, of course, there was (and is) the App Store. Then there was this whole community of blogs and podcasts, and I discovered some amazing tricks and apps. Soon after I bought a Mac on a huge sale, and I immersed myself in the Apple ecossystem. I had used Linux before (and I loved it), but OS X was the power of Linux and Unix, with command line and all that stuff, wrapped in a functional, gorgeous system, with polished apps.

That was in 2012, when a dollar was worth two reals. In my local currency, I was paying twice the price of an app, but it was worth it. I am truly fascinated by software (I like to learn to develop it myself) and I don't mind paying for good work. I feel powered (?) when using OS X, and iOS was a good companion. The combination of Drafts, Omnifocus and Fantastical was just crazy.

But now it's 2016, and things are different. The economy in Brazil is low and the dollar is high. Paying for apps is getting more and more difficult to afford.

And my iPhone is outdated. There's a point that people yelling "you don't have to update your smartphone every year/two years/three years!" miss. Sure, you don't have to always have the newest phone, but we must not forget that apps are update, and developers are interested in getting new features in the SDK. As apps are more sophisticated, they use more resources. After a certain point, your phone is slow because you are using apps that were optimized for a device much better than yours. Then apps start to crash, the system does not respond anymore, and you are constantly annoyed.

I had to upgrade my phone (or at least I really wanted to), but I can't afford an iPhone. Plus, as a tech enthusiast, I really want to try out this Android thing. After a little research, I found that the Moto X Play was a good combination of low price, reasonable specs and a "pure" Android experience (important to me since I want to discover what using Android was all about). I got it in a discount in Black Friday.

In general, I really like it, in particular the customization part. In my computers, I love f.lux, and I was sad that there was no option to do that in iOS (it seems it will be a builtin feature in the next release). In Android there are several apps that do that (I use Twilight).

Then there are widgets!

In general, iOS and the iPhone are much more polished, and I miss the quality and availability of good apps. Android though seems mature, customizable and productivity enhancing. I'm satisfied.
