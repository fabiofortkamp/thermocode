Continuing with my ongoing theme about [simplifying tech](http://thermocode.net/blog/tech), being [more portable](http://thermocode.net/blog/terminal) and  [enjoying open systems](http://thermocode.net/blog/unix) more, I feel obligated to tell my impressions on my first Android xevice: a Moto X Play from 2015.

First the backstory. My parents went to the US on 2012 and brought me a super shiny iPhone 4S (the latest model at the time). I had two proto-smartphones from Nokia before that (in the sense that there were some primitive apps like calendar and email, and that it could serve as an MP3 player), but this was different. It was intuitive, good-loking, well-manufactured. And, of course, there was (and is) the App Store. I got in touch with this whole community of blogs and podcasts, and I discovered some amazing tricks and apps. Soon after that, I bought a Mac on a huge sale, and I immersed myself in the Apple ecossystem. I had used Linux before (and I loved it), and OS X was the power of Linux (and Unix), with command line and all that stuff, wrapped in a functional, gorgeous system, with polished apps.

That was in 2012, when a dollar was worth two reals. In my local currency, I was paying twice the price of an app, but I was OK with it. I am truly fascinated by software (I like to learn to develop it myself) and I don't mind paying for good work. I felt empowered  when using OS X, and iOS was a good companion. The combination of Drafts, Omnifocus and Fantastical was just crazy.

But now it's 2016, and things are different. The economy in Brazil is low and the dollar is high. Paying for apps is getting more and more difficult to afford, and paying for Apple devices is for me downright impossible. But my iPhone 4S is  outdated for 2016, and there's a point that people yelling "you don't have to update your smartphone every year/two years/three years!" miss. Sure, you don't have to always have the newest phone, but since I try to use an iPhone productively, I'd like to use good apps -- but now these apps are optimized for a device much better than yours, and things start to crash or be too slow. Opening a calendar becomes an exercise in patience.

I had to upgrade my phone (or at least I really wanted to), to be able to use it *well*, and as I said I can't afford an iPhone. Plus, as a tech enthusiast, I really want to try out this Android thing. After a little research, I found that the Moto X Play was a good combination of low price, reasonable specs and a "pure" Android experience (important to me since I want to discover what using Android was all about). I got it in a discount in Black Friday. Now it's been four months since, and these are my first impressions.

In general, I really like this device, in particular the customization part. In my computers, I love [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/), and I was sad that there was no option to do that in iOS, since it's such a low-lvel thing (it seems it will be a built-in feature in the next release). In Android there are several apps that do that (I use [Twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=pt_BR)). Besides, with widgets I can create themed home screens. My first screen (the true "home" screen, I guess) contains the icons to the apps I use the most. My second screen contains a [Todoist](http://todoist.com) widget with all my errands, and below that a Evernote widget with my shopping lists. This is fantastic -- when I'm running errands, I can see what I have to do and buy directly in my screen. I have another screen just with reading apps (and no distractions). You get the point. 

I also like how Google services are tightly connected to this device. The pictures I take are automatically uploaded to Google Photos, which I can also use on my Mac *and* in my work PC. Compare this with iCloud photos, which require an Apple device. I don't use Google Now much, but it's sometimes useful, particularly for travel times and the weather.

Of course, there are bad things. Like I said [in my previous post](http://thermocode.net/blog/evernote), I miss a good Markdown editor and more polished apps in the Google Play Store -- this is a fact. But I'm still learning to use the system, and with time I may discover better apps. I also **love** that I can pay reasonable prices in my own currency in the store.


In general, iOS and the iPhone are much more polished, and I miss the quality and availability of good apps. Android, though, seems mature, customizable and productivity enhancing, and it seems that is evolving. I want to continuously simplify my tech needs, and this smartphone allows me to check on my tasks and shopping lists, read on the Kindle and Instapaper apps, listen to podcasts and Spotify, use WhatsApp. I'm satisfied.
