For the past couple of months, I've been using more and more of [Evernote](http://evernote.com) -- a fact which, given my previous history with the software, really surprised me. This revealed some things about my personality and proved some points about *productivity* that I've been reading about.

I don't remember how I started using Evernote. My account was created on June 14th, 2011, and I probably got interested in it by reading sites like [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com) (which used to be good). Soon I got obsessed with organizing all kinds of information there, and spent days trying to create the best structure for notebooks and tags. I discovered great authors who write about Evernote: [Brett Kelly](https://brettkelly.org/), [Jamie Todd Rubin](http://www.jamierubin.net/), and, in Brazil, [Vlad Campos](http://www.vladcampos.com/), whose [excellent book](http://www.vladcampos.com/evernote/livro) (in Portuguese) guided me to my first attempt to using it in a serious way.

Some time later, I started to get increasingly upset with Evernote's desktop apps. My late-2011 MacBook Pro seemed to be not good enough to run it (but excellent for all other applications). Plus, I became annoyed by its non-standard ways of dealing with files, and lack of ways to bulk export the data I had there. I cannot remember exactly why, but one day I decided to completely abandon the platform and moved away  all my notes. I manually created some text notes in a Dropbox folder, developed a file hierarchy for PDF documents (greatly inspired by another great ebook, [*Paperless*, by David Sparks](http://macsparky.com/paperless/)). It was so painful that I vowed to never use Evernote again, which was just me fooling myself. I experimented with it to organize travels (also inspired by a [great book by Vlad Campos](http://www.vladcampos.com/blog/livro-planejando-viagens-com-o-evernote-r)[^1], not sold anymore), but this experiment did not go much further and since then I completely abandoned it.

[^1]: Yes, I really love books

Until I got an Android phone.

When I used iOS, one of my favorite apps was [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/). Remember that Dropbox folder of notes I mentioned? I still use it everyday, and in OS X and Windows I use Emacs (mentioned in [my blog post about Unix](http://thermocode.net/blog/unix/)) with the [deft](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) package to quickly access and manage my notes. Each note is a text file concerning a subject. This system was stolen by the wonderful [Zettelkasten site/method](http://zettelkasten.de/)[^2], and I intend to write more about it in the future. Editorial is a Markdown editor that make it really easy to access these notes in an iPhone or iPad, and has some great editing and automation features. iOS has also the great [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) app, which, when opened, just triggers a text box for you to write anything. I used it to capture all sorts of things, that I then reviewed later in the day. Some were tasks, some were events, some was the drafts of  notes that I sent to my zettelkasten.

[^2]: I also believe that it is important to properly [steal good ideas](http://austinkleon.com/steal/)

The biggest paradox of using Android, an open-source system, based on Linux and much more hacker-friendly, is the lack of good text-based tools. All Markdown editors that I tried are primitive: they keep crashing, they cannot synchronize with Dropbox (and the methods to synchronize the built-in file system with Dropbox are not reliable), or (the most absurd of things) they cannot search inside notes. Since I have hundreds of notes, I cannot manually scroll to find the note I want. There is also no Drafts-like app (again, based on my search; please send me any good apps you know). I wanted a way to quickly record some information on my phone and to access my notes folder.

The majority of searches for notes apps for Android lead to Evernote, so I decided to give it another try to see what would happen. One of the advantages of Android is the ability to have widgets anywhere (and not only on the Today screen, as in iOS), and Evernote provides one to quickly create a note in the default notebook. This was, in effect, my Drafts replacement -- with an advantage. Along the day, I open this widget and create little notes to myself. At the end of the day, I can open Evernote on my computer (which has been upgraded with SSDs and for now *can* run Evernote ) and see the notes there, for easier processing. With this little idea, I started to open and use Evernote  every day.

Then I started to include some information in it. I maintain a list of checklists to some routines I do; closing the workday, packing bags for travels and weekends etc (and this was inspired by [Kouroush Dini and *Creating Flow with Omnifocus, second edition*,](http://www.usingomnifocus.com/) which I've already talked about -- see [my series](http://thermocode.net/blog/better-work/) on his book [*Workflow Mastery*)](http://www.usingomnifocus.com/). This is the type of thing that I want with me all the time, so I moved my plain-text checklists to Evernote-like lists. Everything went fine. Then I started to keep groceries lists, so that I can edit them on both devices (computer and phone) and check what I have to buy when I'm at the supermarket (Evernote also has a widget to show you the contents of a note directly from the home screen). Then I started to maintain my weekly planning note there. And so on.

I still keep my Zettelkasten in Dropbox, and I'm too resistant to move it to Evernote. Some of my notes are actually reference notes (e.g. notes I take while reading a scientific paper), things I really want to keep in a text format so that I can easily include them in other documents (like when using LaTeX). I will have to live with the fact that I cannot edit them on my phone; I hope that soon someone will develop a good Markdown editor app as the platform matures.

But for quick notes and checklists, Evernote has become an important part of my workfdlow. And I'm enjoying it now more than before, when I tried to go "all in". The reason for that may be related to something I read from a little book called [*Getting Results the Agile Way*](http://gettingresults.com/wiki/Main_Page), by J.D. Meier, which is terribly written but has some good advice. One of its key concepts is to avoid analysis paralysis and experiment always and iteratively. When I decided to use Evernote again, I didn't spend hours or days thinking how I would structure it. I configured the widget *right way*, and starting saving notes in my inbox. Then I created a "Checklists" notebook, and experimented with this. Then I created another notebook for shopping lists, and so on. Now I'm fiddling with automatically archiving PDF invoices and other documents I receive by email (and I will have to accept the fact that sometimes convenience beats standardization). Each day I try to watch myself and see how I can improve its usage.

I'm an engineer who uses programming a lot, and I should have known that. Life, like many great problems, is iterative[^3]. 

[^3]: I'm really, really sorry for this terrible last line, but I can't convince myself to not finish this article with it.
