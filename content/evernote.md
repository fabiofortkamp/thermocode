For the past couple of months, I've been using more and more of Evernote -- a fact which, given my previous history with the software, really surprised me. This revaled some things about my personality and proved some points about *productivity* that I've been reading about.

I don't remember how I started using Evernote. My account was created on June 14th, 2011, and I got the interested by reading sites like Lifehacker (which used to be good). I got obsessed with organizing all kinds of information there, and spent days trying to create the best structure for notebooks and tags. I discovered great authors who wrote about Evernote: Brett Kelly, Jamie Rubin, and, in Brazil, Vlad Campos, whose excelent book guided me to my first attempt to using it big time.

Some time after, I got increasingly upset with its desktop apps. The laptops I had seem to be not good enough to run it (but excellent for all other applications). Plus, I became annoyed by its non-standard ways of dealing with files, and lack of ways to bulk export the data I had there. I cannot remember also exactly why, but one day I decided to completely abandon the platform and move all my notes. I manually created some text notes in a Dropbox folder, created a file hierarchy for PDF documents (greatly inspired by another great ebook, Paperless by David Spark). It was so painful that I vowed to never use Evernote again, which was just foolish. I experimented with it to organize travels (also inspired by a great book by Vlad Campos)[^1], but since then I completely abandoned it.

[^1]: Yes, I really love books

Until I got an Android phone.

When I used iOS, one of my favorite apps was Editorial. Remember that Dropbox folder of notes I mentioned? I still use it everyday, and in OS X and Windows I use Emacs with the deft package to quickly access and manage my note. Each note is a text file, concerning a subject. This system was stolen by the zettelkasten site, and I intend to write more about it in the future. Editorial is a Markdown editor that make it really easy to access these notes, and has some great editing features. iOS has also the great Drafts app, which, when opened, just triggers a text box for you to write anything. I used it to capture all sorts of things, that I reviewed later in the day. Some were tasks, some were events, some was the draft of a note that I sent to my zettelkasten.

The biggest paradox of using Android, an open-source system, based on Linux and much more hacker-friendly is the lack of good text-based tools, and this is my bigget complain with the paltform. All Markdown editors that I tried are primitive: they keep crashing, they cannot synchorinze with Dropbox, or (the most absurd of things) they cannot search in notes. Since I have hundreds of notes, I cannot manually scroll to find the note I want. There is also no Drafts-like app (again, based on my search). I needed a way to quickly recording some information on my phone, and I wanted a way to access my notes folder.

The majority of searches for notes apps for Android lead to Evernote, so I decided to give it another try to see what would happen. One of the advantages of Android is the ability to have widgets anywhere (and not only on the Today screen, as in iOS), and Evernote provides one to quickly create a note in the default notebook. This was, in effect, my Drafts replacement -- with an advantage. Along the day, I open this widget and create little notes to myself. At the end of the day, I can open Evernote on my computer (which has been upgraded) and see the notes there, for easier processing. I do miss Drafts actions, though. So, I started to every day opening and using Evernote.

Then I started to include some information in Evernote. I maintain a list of checklists to some routines I do; closing the workday, packing bags for travels and weekends etc (and this was inspired by Kouroush Dini and *Creating Flow with Omnifocus, second edition*, which I've already talked about). This is the type of things that I want with me all the time, so I moves my plain-text checlist to Evernote-like lists. Everything went fine. Then I started to keep groceries lsits, so that I can edit them on both devices (computer and phone) and check what I have to buy when I'm at the supermarket. Then I started to maintain my weekly planning note there. And so on.

I still keep my zettelkasten in Dropbox, and I'm to resitant to move it to Evernote. Some of my notes I actually reference notes, things I really want to keep in a text formatted so that I can easily include them in other documents. I will have to live with the fact that I can edit them on my phone; I hope that soon someone will develop a good Markdown editor app, as the platform matures.

But for quick notes and checklists, Evernote has become an important part of my workfdlow. And I'm enjoying it now more than before, when I tried to go "all in". The reason for that is something I read from a little book called "Getting Results the Agile Way", which is terribly written but has some good advice. One of its key concepts is to avoid analysis paralysis and experiment always and iteratively. When I decided to use Evernote again, I didn't spend hours or days thinking how I would structure it. I configured the widget, and starting saving notes in my inbox. Then I created a "Checklists" notebook, and experimented with there. Then I created another notebook for shopping lists, and so on. Now I'm experimenting with automatically sending PDF invoices and other documents, since I can automate the documents I receive by email (and I will have to accept the fact that sometimes convenience beats stardization).

I started to use Evernote before I read that book, but it served as a good example. I *love* analyzing things, and I could easily create organizational schemes for a living. This leads to no results, then, so tis served as a reminder that, not before too long in a project, I just have to *start* and experiment. Later I can improve.

I'm an engineer who uses programming a lot, and I should've known that. Life, like many great problems, it's iterative.
